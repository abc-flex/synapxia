# CLAUDE.md

**Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first** — it is the canonical guidance for AI agents in
this repo (architecture, Constitution rules, conventions, workflow). This file is a thin
pointer.

## Key Rules

- Before any task: read `memory/MEMORY.md` and skim the last 3–5 entries of `memory/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Every important group of changes — each PR, each merge commit, and each direct push to `develop` / `main` / `production` — gets **one** rollup entry in `memory/CHANGELOG.md` (newest at top, never edit other PRs' entries). Include date **and** time (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, 24h local) so same-day entries stay ordered. If you commit again on the same branch (review fixups, follow-ups), update your existing entry — don't append another. Direct pushes are not exempt. See `AGENTS.md` "Mandatory update rules" for the full table and format.
- If project state changed (new feature done, architectural decision, new blocker): update `memory/MEMORY.md`.

## Repo at a glance

SynapxIA is a modular monolith with three surfaces, run together via Docker Compose:

- **API** — FastAPI + SQLModel (`uv`), port 8000 → see [`api/CLAUDE.md`](api/CLAUDE.md)
- **UI** — Astro + Tailwind (Bun), port 4321 → see [`ui/CLAUDE.md`](ui/CLAUDE.md)
- **DB** — PostgreSQL 18, SQL migrations, container port 5432 (host `5442`, via `DB_HOST_PORT`) → see [`db/CLAUDE.md`](db/CLAUDE.md)

## Everyday commands

```bash
make dev    # start everything + print URLs and login (admin / Admin123!)
make test   # health checks (API, DB, admin user)
make logs   # tail logs (logs-api / logs-db / logs-ui for one service)
make down   # stop
```

## Security Implementation (PR #25)

As of PR #25, **all API endpoints are secured with JWT authentication + role-based access control (RBAC)**:

- ✅ All endpoints require valid JWT token (401 Unauthorized if missing)
- ✅ Privilege matrix enforced per user profile (403 Forbidden if insufficient)
- ✅ Frontend routes protected with Astro middleware
- ✅ Rate limiting on login (5 attempts = 15-min lockout)

**For deployment to Vercel**, see [`SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT.md`](SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT.md) — requires:
- `SECRET_KEY` environment variable (generate: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` pointing to deployed UI URL
- `APP_ENV=production`

Local development uses defaults (see `.env.template`), but production Vercel deployment is **security-critical**.

## Before you commit

Governance is binding — see [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md)
and the pre-PR checklist in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Features are spec-driven; specs live
in [`specs/`](specs/).
