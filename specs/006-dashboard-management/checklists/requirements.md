## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- Clarifications resolved 2026-10-01. Q1: status transitions = option A. Q2: context binding = option A (grant binding), extended by the user with list and viewer-input value sources, which the Execute story prompts for in a parameters window (FR-018/FR-018a).
- All items pass.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
